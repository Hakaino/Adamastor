# Adamastor

**Adamastor** is a side-scrolling platformer game that I developed in 2017, marking my first major programming project. It served as my introduction to both Java and mobile software development. 

In the game, players explore immersive levels while interacting with the environment through intuitive swipe gestures on the screen. 

### Features:
- **Platformer Mechanics**: Classic side-scrolling action with fluid platforming.
- **Swipe-Based Interaction**: Swipe the screen to trigger environmental changes or special actions.
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Developed specifically for mobile devices, ensuring smooth performance.

### My Learning Journey:
Creating this game was a hands-on way for me to learn Java, and it also gave me practical experience in mobile app development. Working on **Adamastor** taught me how to design game mechanics, handle touch inputs, and optimize performance for Android devices.

### Get the Game:
**Adamastor** is available for download on [Google Playstore](https://apkpure.com/adamastor/antigos.segredos.adamastor).
