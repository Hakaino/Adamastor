# Adamastor
Probably my greatest programing project from 2017, making this game is how i learned java.
This a project that I started alone to learn java and mobile software development.
It is a side scroll platformer where you can also use swipe the screen to interact with the envyronment.
It is published on Google Playstore (https://apkpure.com/adamastor/antigos.segredos.adamastor).
